# Pong Clone
A simple Pong clone written in C using SDL3.

## Requirements
- SDL3 development libraries
- GCC or Clang (or another C compiler)
- Make
- Doxygen (optional, for documentation generation)

## Building the Project
To compile the game:

```bash
make
```

This will build the project and place the executable inside `bin` folder

## Building documentation

```bash
doxygen
```

This will generate a generic documentation based on the JAVADOC-styled comments in the code.

The documentation will be created in the `html/` directory (or as specified in the `Doxyfile`).
